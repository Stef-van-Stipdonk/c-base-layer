# c-base-layer

Currently in the very early stages.
Will be adding more over time.

Next on the chopping block: floating point constants, then basic memory management.

# TODO
- Add context cracking for architecture
- Add lists(dynamic arrays, linked lists etc)
- Add basic memory management(like arenas)
- Add string types
- Add in helper macros(haven't had the need to use them recently, so not adding them now)
- Add Floating point constants
- Add basic type conversion macros 

# Features
 - Basic context cracking(checks for gcc/clang and linux/mac/windows)
 - Base constants(min/max unsigned/signed etc)
